# Day 1 Exercise 1

Our goal in this exercise is to create the database tables and fill them with
some seed data.

Take a look at
[managing the database](https://tech-docs.corndel.com/javalin/managing-the-database.html)

In the `./src/main/resources/db/migration` folder, you will find the `.sql` used
by flyway to create the database.

We've included a `V2__Seed.sql` file in the root of this project. You will need
to move it to the correct location for Flyway to pick up the file during
migration.

## Todo

- [x] Run `./mvnw test -Dtest=D1E1Tests`. You should see a couple of faling
      tests!

- [x] Run `./mvnw flyway:migrate` to create the tables. Running this script
      should automatically create the database file called `nozama.db` in the
      root of your project, if it doesn't exist already.

- [x] Run the D1E1 tests again.

- [x] Test again to see that the first two tests are now passing.

- [x] Move the `V2__Seed.sql` file into the correct directory

- [x] Run the `flyway:migrate` command again.

- [x] Test again to see that all tests are now passing.
